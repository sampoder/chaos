# ðŸŒŸ Chaos

Generative art exhibition for my school's Arts Festival. The theme of the event was "Chaos".

Inspired by [@SquarePear](https://github.com/SquarePear)'s wonderful [Particle Physics workshop](https://workshops.hackclub.com/particle_physics/) and [`sampoder/sound-festival`](https://github.com/sampoder/sound-festival).
